This project is an academic exercise in processing data. 
It is inspired by the 1 billion line challenge, and is meant to demonstrate differences in effectiveness.

The project consists of a basic winform UI where the user can choose a path for what data they want to handle/generate. a button for generating data. 
3 radio buttons where 1 of 3 methods can be choosen. The three methods is in theory more and more effective, but is this the case?

Project Dependencies:
Serilog
Serilog.Sinks.WinForms 2.5.0 (please note this gives a warning, because it is a legacy finction, but the only way i got logging to work in the form)

In a "real" setting i propably would not use winforms as the UI, but this is a nice exercise!
